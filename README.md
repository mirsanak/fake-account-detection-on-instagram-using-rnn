Fake Account Detection on Instagram using RNN

Description

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect fake social media accounts on Instagram. By analyzing engagement trends and activity patterns over time, the model predicts whether an account is real or fake.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of deep learning model that are particularly effective for sequential data analysis. In the context of fake account detection on Instagram, RNN can be useful if the model considers time-based behaviors of an account, such as:

Post frequency over time
Engagement patterns over time
Followers growth trends
 How RNN Works in Fake Account Detection
Feature Extraction:

Collect Instagram account data, such as:
Follower and following growth over time
Engagement rate trends (likes, comments, shares over days/weeks)
Posting activity over time
Preprocessing the Data:

Convert time-based features into sequences.
Normalize the data for efficient learning.
Split into training and testing sets.
Building the RNN Model:

Input Layer: Processes sequential data.
Recurrent Layers (LSTM/GRU): Capture dependencies in engagement behavior.
Dense Output Layer: Predicts whether an account is fake or real.
Training the Model:

Uses backpropagation through time (BPTT) to optimize weights.
Evaluates using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
